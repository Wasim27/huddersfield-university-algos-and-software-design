 * <p>
 * Examples of programme proofs and of assertions in Java.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The square class implements the square method from the unit notes, and includes Java assertions based on the
 * programme proof from the unit notes.  Try running the square class (it includes a main method).  Now try
 * introducing deliberate errors and run it again.  If you don't see an assertion error it may be that you
 * have not enabled assertions in the virtual machine.  See the exercise notes and/or video for details on how
 * to enable assertions.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The cube class contains an implementation of a cube method similar to the square methods in the square class.
 * This time, however, there are no assertions.  You should develop a proof of the cube method.  You could then
 * add assertions mirroring your proof to the cube class, and try running it with and without deliberate errors.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <i>Please note:</i>  The fact that a programme with assertions runs without errors is <b><i>not</i></b> a proof that the programme is
 * correct.  The proof comes from human understanding of the proof, probably helped by elucidations and
 * justifications of the assertions in the proof.
